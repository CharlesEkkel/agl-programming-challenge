# AGL Programming Challenge

## Approach

I have built 2 solutions to the given task: one using ReactJS with the NextJS full-stack framework, and the other uses Haskell and several libraries to serve pre-rendered content.

While the requirements clearly state I can use any language I like, I just thought I'd cover my bases, as well as offering two different solutions. And regardless, it was kinda fun!

[TODO: Rephrase below? It's a bit preachy]

My haskell approach is all server-side, which works very well for this task given that there is no interactivity (not that there aren't solutions to that). Meanwhile, using a UI framework like React allows easy & dynamic querying from the client side - not that that is particularly useful here - and NextJS (using Node) lets us use the same language for both the backend and frontend, which is neat.

## Usage
